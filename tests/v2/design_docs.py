"""The folder layout of docs/design/rules/ and docs/design/decisions/.

The one place that knows it: every other reader of the design docs goes
through these functions, so the parsers keep reading the text they
always read, and a change of layout is a change here.

Each folder holds a README.md whose Markdown links, in order, are the
index: one link per file, its text ``<key> — <name>``. A rule, a
section and a rule-keyed decisions entry are filed as
``<key>-<slug of the name>.md``; a decisions entry keyed by a slug is
filed under the slug alone, which already is a name. A citation names
the key only (``rules/S2``, ``decisions/vocabulary-collisions``), so
renaming a file never breaks one.
