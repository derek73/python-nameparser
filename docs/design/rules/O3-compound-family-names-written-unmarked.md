# O3 — compound family names written unmarked

O3. Rationale: several traditions write compound family names
    unmarked, so that every word after the given name belongs to the
    family name.
    With compound-family handling active, every middle word joins
    the family name and is rendered before it; no word is a middle
    name.
      "Hassan Mohamad Ali"  middle_as_family  →  family="Mohamad Ali"
      "Hassan Mohamad Ali"                    →  family="Ali"  · boundary
